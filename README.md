# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-for-NYC-Citi-Bike

In this project, I have tried to perform Exploratory Data Analysis using the NYC Citi Bike data. I have tried to answer two main questions in this project.
1. How does trip length vary based on trip start time?
2. Which bike stations are most popular to start trips from?

I have used pandas, numpy and seaborn libraries for this project. Have performed joining operation and used folium for data visualization.
